## Hey!

This is my first app in Flutter, built for learning purposes.

---

### Working:

- Single screen layout
- Add a new task by title
- Tap **Save** to store the task to the Hive Storage*
- Tasks are listed below the Save button
- Each task shows **date and time**
- Tasks are **sorted oldest first**
- Each task can be **deleted**

---

### Thanks!

Thanks for checking it out!  
I'm still learning Flutter, and this app is part of that journey.  
More features and improvements coming soon!
